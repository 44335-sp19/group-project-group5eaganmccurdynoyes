      <p>"Knacktive is an advanced, undergraduate, course/agency experience at Northwest Missouri State University.  The elective course is designed to replicate the creative demands and intense teamwork atmosphere of a technology-oriented, professional marketing communications agency." I participated in Knacktive as a copywriter on the eight person Cultivators team in the Spring of 2018. We worked closely as we created a pitch for the nonprofit <a href= "http://www.americanroyal.com/">American Royal</a>. I learned valuable skills while working with my team. These skills included how to communicate effectively, great time management skills, and how to problem solve quickly. I created mock-ups for pamphlets and worked closely with each person to complete a 48 page pitchbook. I learned the value of hardwork and relying on other people to complete tasks. We worked together as a team well and completed a great presentation to the client at the end of the semester. </p>
