      <h4>Python Project</h4>
      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6">
              <img src="Nicole/PythonProjectOutput.JPG" width="70%" height="450px" id="nicolePython">
          </div>
           <div class="col-sm-6">
              <p>I learned how to code Python in Programming 1 class at Northwest. Shown to the left is an output for a project that I have completed in Python code. The objective of this project was to create a random guessing game. First, I prompted the user to enter a maximum number for the range of the guessing game. I entered 100, so the game should generate a random number between 0 and 100. Then, the program asked me to give a number within the range. I happened to input 2, which was too low. The code told me that my guess was too low and asked me to enter another number. This kept happening until I guessed the correct number, 92, and the program told me that I was correct. Then, the program showed me how many guesses it took to get the number and asked me if I wanted to play again. <br> I used the random function (this had to be imported), input, nested while loops, and if-else statements, among other things, within the code to create this output. I liked creating this code because guessing games are fun and I was able to use great base-layer coding. </p>

      <h4>Java Project</h4>
      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6">
              <p>Java was taught in Programming 2 and Data Structures class. This image was the output of a project in Data Structures. It took records from a file called 'Health Records' and read the file. Then, it printed each record by 'first name, last name, age, weight, height, and BMI'. Then, the java program checked to see if each were within valid parameters and threw an error if they weren't. Then, it told the user what the error was and kept going through the file until all records were finished. </p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-6">
              <p>The image to the left shows a snippet of code from MySQL. I showed one specific problem of code written out because it would be very difficult to include every file and every problem that I could work out. So, I used a database called Clearwater. This database has multiple tables: category, color, cust_order, customer, inventory, item, order_line, order_source, shipment, and shipment_line. Each table has multiple columns and data input into them. For this example, I wanted to show the order ID, the customer's last name, customer's first name, the item ID, and the color of the item. For this to work, I had to make sure that no field was ambiguous and that every column that had the same values in each table equalled each other. Then, I wanted to show only one entry per last name, so I grouped my results by the customer's last name. Finally, I wanted to sort by the order ID, so it is sorted in ascending order. </p>

      <p>"Knacktive is an advanced, undergraduate, course/agency experience at Northwest Missouri State University.  The elective course is designed to replicate the creative demands and intense teamwork atmosphere of a technology-oriented, professional marketing communications agency." I participated in Knacktive as a copywriter on the eight person Cultivators team in the Spring of 2018. We worked closely as we created a pitch for the nonprofit <a href= "http://www.americanroyal.com/">American Royal</a>. I learned valuable skills while working with my team. These skills included how to communicate effectively, great time management skills, and how to problem solve quickly. I created mock-ups for pamphlets and worked closely with each person to complete a 48 page pitchbook. I learned the value of hardwork and relying on other people to complete tasks. We worked together as a team well and completed a great presentation to the client at the end of the semester. </p>
