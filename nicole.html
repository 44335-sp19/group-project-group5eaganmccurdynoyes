              <p>I learned how to code Python in Programming 1 class at Northwest. Shown to the left is an output for a project that I have completed in Python code. The objective of this project was to create a random guessing game. First, I prompted the user to enter a maximum number for the range of the guessing game. I entered 100, so the game should generate a random number between 0 and 100. Then, the program asked me to give a number within the range. I happened to input 2, which was too low. The code told me that my guess was too low and asked me to enter another number. This kept happening until I guessed the correct number, 92, and the program told me that I was correct. Then, the program showed me how many guesses it took to get the number and asked me if I wanted to play again. <br> I used the random function (this had to be imported), input, nested while loops, and if-else statements, among other things, within the code to create this output. I liked creating this code because guessing games are fun and I was able to use great base-layer coding. </p>

              <p>The image to the left shows a snippet of code from MySQL. I showed one specific problem of code written out because it would be very difficult to include every file and every problem that I could work out. So, I used a database called Clearwater. This database has multiple tables: category, color, cust_order, customer, inventory, item, order_line, order_source, shipment, and shipment_line. Each table has multiple columns and data input into them. For this example, I wanted to show the order ID, the customer's last name, customer's first name, the item ID, and the color of the item. For this to work, I had to make sure that no field was ambiguous and that every column that had the same values in each table equalled each other. Then, I wanted to show only one entry per last name, so I grouped my results by the customer's last name. Finally, I wanted to sort by the order ID, so it is sorted in ascending order. </p>

      <p>"Knacktive is an advanced, undergraduate, course/agency experience at Northwest Missouri State University.  The elective course is designed to replicate the creative demands and intense teamwork atmosphere of a technology-oriented, professional marketing communications agency." I participated in Knacktive as a copywriter on the eight person Cultivators team in the Spring of 2018. We worked closely as we created a pitch for the nonprofit <a href= "http://www.americanroyal.com/">American Royal</a>. I learned valuable skills while working with my team. These skills included how to communicate effectively, great time management skills, and how to problem solve quickly. I created mock-ups for pamphlets and worked closely with each person to complete a 48 page pitchbook. I learned the value of hardwork and relying on other people to complete tasks. We worked together as a team well and completed a great presentation to the client at the end of the semester. </p>
